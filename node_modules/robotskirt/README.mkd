Robotskirt
=============

Robotskirt is a simple node binding for the [sundown](https://github.com/tanoku/sundown) markdown parser. It was inspired by the redcarpet gem [released by github](https://github.com/blog/832-rolling-out-the-redcarpet). Eventually robotskirt should mirror the feature set of redcarpet, currently it is lacking flags.

Install
-------------

The best way to install robotskirt is by using [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm). If you want to install it globally, remember to include the -g flag.

```bash
npm install robotskirt
```

If you would like to compile it, you can use node's WAF wapper. Read more about how node C/C++ addons work in the [node docs](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/addons.html).

```bash
node-waf configure build
````

Usage
------------

Currently robotskirt has one main function, `toHtml`, that will take a string of markdown and a callback that will be passed the parsed HTML. 

```javascript
var markdown = require('robotskirt');
markdown.toHtml('# Hello World', function (html) {
  sys.puts(html);
});
// '<h1>Hello World</h1>\n'
```

A common use case might be opening a markdown file and then parsing it into HTML.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');                       
var sys = require('sys');                     
var markdown = require('robotskirt');         
                                              
fs.readFile('README.mkd', function (err, data) {
  markdown.toHtml(data.toString(), function (html) {
    sys.puts(html);            
  });
});                                           
```

If you would like to parse your markdown synchronously you can use the `toHtmlSync` function.

```javascript
var html = markdown.toHtmlSync("*sync!*");
```
